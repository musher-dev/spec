# --- Logging ---

# Logs a timestamped message to stderr.
#
# Arguments:
#   $@ — message text
# Outputs:
#   Writes timestamped message to stderr
log() {
  echo "[$(date '+%H:%M:%S')] $*" >&2
}

# Logs a message only when MUSHER_LOG_LEVEL=debug.
#
# .env.example advertises MUSHER_LOG_LEVEL as the way to raise the setup
# scripts' log level. Nothing read it, so the switch was documentation for a
# feature that did not exist. This is that feature.
#
# Globals:
#   MUSHER_LOG_LEVEL — read, defaults to "info"
# Arguments:
#   $@ — message text
# Outputs:
#   Writes to stderr via log() when debug is on, nothing otherwise

# Reports whether an install guarded by a MUSHER_INSTALL_* switch is wanted.
#
# devcontainer.json declares MUSHER_INSTALL_CLAUDE and MUSHER_INSTALL_CODEX and
# .env.example documents them as the way to "skip the AI CLI installs on a slow
# connection". No script read either one, so both CLIs installed unconditionally
# — and they are most of the several minutes a cold container spends inside
# postCreateCommand. This is what makes the documented switch real.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 — the switch's value, e.g. "${MUSHER_INSTALL_CLAUDE:-1}"
# Returns:
#   0 when the install is wanted, 1 when it is switched off

# --- NPM install helper ---

# --- Verification ---

# Verifies that a list of commands are available on the PATH and can run.

# Being on the PATH is not enough. A release binary fetched for the wrong CPU
# architecture resolves fine and then dies with `exec format error` (exit 126)
# the first time anything invokes it, which is a failure worth catching at
# container build rather than mid-task. Every tool checked here exits 0 on
# `--version`, so a non-zero status means the binary is not runnable.
#
# Arguments:
#   $@ — command names to check
# Outputs:
#   Writes status of each tool to stderr via log()
# Returns:
#   0 if all tools found and runnable, 1 otherwise
